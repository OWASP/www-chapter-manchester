### 2017
#### 2017 April
* 24th April
    * I found a Vulnerability! - **Alex Haynes**
        * The talk will cover vulnerability disclosure and the pitfalls to avoid both as a security researcher and as a company exposed to vulnerabilities. We'll also cover different types of disclosure programs like Bugcrowd and Hackerone, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. The Grey market will get a brief look and of course we'll talk about vulnerabilities. Lots and lots of vulnerabilities.
    * Distributed Policy Enforcement with OpenSSH Certificates - **Tim Fletcher**
        * OpenSSH is installed on nearly every virtual machine, physical server and many IoT devices. OpenSSH is a critical systems administration tool used to manage everything from the server in the shed to continent spanning collections of systems.
          Logging in to OpenSSH quickly and security is normally done with keys, sometimes using strong passwords and hardware key storage all too often left lying about on laptops.
          Managing the list of keys and permissions for an organisation of more than a handful of people rapidly gets challenging, tracking who has used which key to do what even more so.
          Using the CA feature of OpenSSH it is possible to remove all this complexity, and leverage OpenSSH to enforce your central policies and provide you with strong audit trails.
          The talk will cover the technical aspects of what can be done with SSH certificates and the implementation for SSH certificates for an IoT focused business. The management server the business uses will be released shortly before the talk as an OSS project during the FLOSSUK Conference in March.
    * *Hosted by ThoughtWorks at their newly refurbished City Tower offices right in the heart of the city. ThoughtWorks will also be providing the pizza.*

### 2016
#### 2016 November
* 30th November
    * An Anatomy of IoT Security - **Dominic Chell**
        * With an estimated 26 billion devices online by 2020 and in wake of a number of large scale IoT hacks, IoT security has come under close scrutiny of late. This talk provides a whistle-stop tour in to the world of IoT hacking, discussing the various IoT attack surfaces and using practical examples to illustrate the OWASP Internet of Things Top 10.
    * JSON Hijacking - **Gareth Heyes**
        * JSON hijacking is supposedly dead after the Array constructor and "Object.prototype" setter bugs have been patched or is it? This talk will show how it's still possible to steal JSON data cross domain using various browser bugs. Gareth will take us on an epic journey of bug discovery and if we have time he may even bypass CSP for fun.
    * *Kindly sponsored by Computer Science at University of Salford (Host), Pentest UK and Hedgehog Security.*

#### 2016 June
* 16th June ([Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-meeting-16th-june-2016-tickets-25550865326#))
    * Digital Forensics: The missing piece of the Internet of Things promise - **Dr. Ali Dehghantanha**
        * Every new device we create, every sensor we deploy, every byte we synchronize to other locations will at some point come under scrutiny in the course of investigations and legal matters. Yet no reliable forensics applications nor digital forensics guidance exists to retrieve the data from IoT devices in the event of a cyber event, an active investigation or a litigation request. The digital forensics of internet of things (IoT) technologies is the missing conversation in our headlong rush to the promise of connecting every device on the planet. This presentation discuss about issues and importance of further development in this field and elaborates on how forensics practitioners, device manufacturers and legal authorities could share the efforts and minimise this gap.
        * Speaker's Bio: Dr. Ali Dehghantanha is a Marie-Curie International Incoming Fellow in Cyber Forensics and has served for many years in a variety of research and industrial positions. Other than Ph.D in Cyber Security he holds many professional certificates such as GREM, CISM, CISSP, and CCFP. He has served as an expert witness, cyber forensics analysts and malware researcher with leading players in Cyber-Security and E-Commerce.
    * Teaching secure coding - **Paul Johnston**
        * Many organisations invest heavily in detecting application vulnerabilities, using static analysis and pen testing. Another tool in your security arsenal is to prevent vulnerabilities being introduced in the first place. To help with this, Pentest provide a "Secure coding workshop". The workshop teaches developers how to code securely, and avoid vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XML external entities. Having run this course with several programming languages, and students of various abilities, we've learned a lot about the pedagogy of secure coding. In this talk we share some of our key insights for delivering a successful secure coding workshop.
        * Speaker's Bio: Paul is a security consultant at Pentest, working mostly on web application tests, and the secure coding workshop. He is interested in static analysis, and how frameworks can encourage developers to write secure applications. When he's not on the computer, you might see him running or on a mountain bike.
    * Tackling Cyber Crime in the North West - **Jennie Williams**
        * The National Security Strategy categorised cyber-attacks as a Tier One threat to our national security, alongside international terrorism. The threat to our national security from cyber-attacks is real and growing. Terrorists, hostile states and cyber criminals are among those targeting computer systems in the UK. We all need to work together to combat this threat and help protect one another.
        * Speaker's Bio: Jennie Williams is a Cyber Protect Officer at TITAN, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit. Her role involves working with business, education and the general public to raise awareness of the potential risk and impact of Cyber Crime along with the simple steps that can be taken to prevent becoming a victim.
    * *Kindly hosted by SpaceportX and sponsored by Avecto*


#### 2016 March
* 17th March ([Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/owasp-manchester-meeting-17th-march-tickets-22527547501))
    * Turning over a new Leaf - **Scott Helme**
        * How the world’s bestselling electric car, the Nissan Leaf can be accessed remotely to activate the climate control and spy on details of the driver’s journeys simply by knowing or guessing the VIN of the vehicle. This may seem like a harmless prank but could be used to void warranties or drain batteries remotely, with Nissan looking to add GPS tracking to the vehicles this issue could have become a whole lot worse.
        * Speaker bio: Scott is a Pen Tester by day and runs several well-known security sites and blogs by night including report-uri.io, securityheaders.io and scotthelme.co.uk.
    *  Blind detection of path traversal-vulnerable file uploads - **Julian Horoszkiewicz**

### 2015
#### 2015 November
* 12th November
    * Scott Helme
        * Modern browsers have introduced new security features that websites can activate using server headers: CSP, HSTS and HPKP. I analysed the use of these headers on the Alexa Top 1 Million sites. The results are not what you might expect and the data shows some interesting trends.

    * Nikola Milosevic
        * Android users face many threats and risks. Since modern mobile devices are almost all the time exposed to the internet and other types of mobile networks, they are always exposed to the attacks. Users are usually not aware of the threats. OWASP Seraphimdroid is an OWASP project initiative with an aim to protect users from the threats by giving them the right tools in the form of mobile application and to educate them trough it. In this talk Nikola will present the current state and some interesting features of OWASP Seraphimdroid.
        * Speaker bio: Nikola is a project leader of OWASP Seraphimdroid project and one of the chapter leaders in Manchester. Previously, he founded and led OWASP local chapter in Serbia in 2012.

#### 2011 August
* 24th August
    * *As part of the Leeds Chapter*
    * OWASP Chapter introduction. OWASP values and membership. Chapter information.
        * OWASP Manchester board member
    * SSL: Paved with Good Intentions - **Richard Moore, CTO Westpoint Ltd**
        * [PDF: Slides](https://wiki.owasp.org/images/7/7a/SSL_paved_with_good_intentions.pdf)
        * [PDF: Colour map of CAs](https://wiki.owasp.org/images/8/8e/Colour_map_of_CAs.pdf)
        * At first glance, SSL seems very complicated to add to your site.
          Once you become a little more knowledgeable you know that it's a simple matter of getting a certificate from a trusted CA and installing it.
          Unfortunately you were right the first time, and it is actually very complicated to do correctly.
          This talk aims to explain how the various parts of SSL fit together to provide users with decent security, showing the problems components like OCSP and certificates solve.
          As well as explaining the evolution of SSL over time, it will cover enhancements that are just reaching deployment such as Server Name Indication and OCSP stapling.
          Finally, it will also highlight various ways that everyone from SSL implementers, system administrators, browser developers to users can manage to undo all this hard work and make it insecure anyway.
        * Speaker Bio: Richard is CTO of Westpoint Ltd, a security testing company based in Manchester. He has been working in the security industry for many years providing services to a wide range of clients including multi-nationals and banks.
          Richard has extensive experience in SSL from both the point of view of a software developer as one of the maintainers of the SSL support in Nokia's Qt library and KDE, and also from a security testing perspective.
    * Forensic Readiness – Give your investigators a fighting chance - **Ryan Jones, SpiderLabs Incident Response Team leader**
        * Investigators are often faced with poorly configured systems which thwart the investigative process. This leads commonly leads to incident response reports with fragmented timelines of attack and leaves risk managers having to make difficult decisions based on incomplete information.
          Companies that consider Forensic Readiness put their investigators in a much stronger position and can expect considerably more accurate outcomes from a forensic investigation.
          This talk looks at the same web application attack, carried out on systems with differing audit controls. The first system has ‘out of the box’ logging and the second has had logging improved through a Forensic Readiness process carried out before the attack.
          We approach the machines as an Incident Response Specialist would and compare the evidence stores and the ability of the investigators to make accurate conclusions based on the evidence available. We will look at the contrasting final reports which are produced with the differing levels of forensic evidence, highlighting the decisions that have to be made based on the varying level of detail provided in the reports.
          Someone for whom forensic investigation of web application exploits is a new topic will gain an understanding of some of the forensic techniques possible. Whilst attendees who already have some forensic investigation knowledge will understand how forensic readiness can have a massive effect on the outcome of investigations.
        * Speaker Bio:Ryan Jones currently leads the SpiderLabs Incident Response Team in EMEA. The team commonly manages data compromises related to cardholder data but are also regularly involved in other projects such as ATM compromises and data breaches caused by internal staff. The Incident Response team also carry out proactive engagements to ensure that customers have an effective incident response plan; drawing upon extensive knowledge of how it goes wrong in real data security breaches to improve companies’ approach to Incident Response.
