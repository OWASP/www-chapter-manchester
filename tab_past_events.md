  <summary><b>Proactive Security - How do you prevent vulnerabilities? - 7th March 2023</b></summary>
  
  <h3>Details</h3>

  In this session we'll be discussing Proactive Security. Meaning, how do you empower and enable engineering teams to own their own security to prevent the release of vulnerable code... What would secure coding practices look like, what is security by design, what security testing can teams do during the test & release process. More importantly, what can we put in place to really make the security teams work for their money.
