  <br><br>
  <h3>Talks</h3>

<h3>MD Shafquat Hossain Khan - Social Engineering in the Age of Deepfakes</h3>


Social engineering has long been one of the most effective techniques for cyber attackers, exploiting human trust to breach systems. With the rise of deepfake technology, attackers now wield tools that blur the line between reality and deception, and the stakes have never been higher. This talk explores how deepfakes are revolutionizing social engineering tactics, providing real-world examples of deepfake-enabled phishing, impersonation, and disinformation campaigns.

<br><br>

<b>About MD Shafquat Hossain Khan</b><br>

A cybersecurity professional with a passion for offensive security, ethical hacking, and penetration testing. He holds a BSc in Computer Science from Swansea University and has earned certifications such as the Google Professional Cybersecurity Certificate, CompTIA Security+, and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC). Currently studying for the CompTIA PenTest+, he actively develops his skills through hands-on projects, including building a phishing attack simulator, developing a host-based intrusion detection system, and diving deeper into the realm of ethical hacking.
Outside of cybersecurity, Shafquat enjoys gaming—both as a player and a designer, working on his own surreal, narrative-driven video game. He also makes music, spends time discovering new artists, and is currently learning to play the guitar (though he won’t be headlining any concerts just yet). Whether it’s hacking, game design, or jamming out, he’s always looking for the next thing to master.

<h3>Jay Harris - Putting Flutter in the Gutter: how to reverse engineer flutter applications</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@owaspmanchester3052/featured" rel="noreferrer">Talk recording coming soon</a>
<br><br>
In the ever-evolving landscape of mobile application development, Flutter has emerged as a powerful framework, enabling developers to create cross-platform applications with a single codebase. However, with innovation comes the need for robust security measures. This talk aims to delve into the realm of reverse engineering and security assessment specific to Flutter mobile applications.

Reverse engineering, the process of dissecting and understanding the inner workings of an application, is a double-edged sword. While developers leverage it for debugging and optimization, adversaries exploit it to identify vulnerabilities and potential security weaknesses. In this presentation, we will explore various reverse engineering techniques tailored to Flutter apps, shedding light on the underlying architecture and highlighting potential attack vectors.

<h3>Stuart Crawford - AppSec in the Enterprise: in-flight testing and Shifting Left</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SHJBKGCu_4" rel="noreferrer">Talk recording</a>
<br><br>
In a world where web-based applications are ubiquitous, penetration testing is well-established as a way of verifying those applications are secure, but how do we stop finding ourselves falling into an endless cycle of 'deploy, test, fix'?
The answer is by paying closer attention to security in the development lifecycle, and I'll provide an example of how we're doing this at one of, if not the largest Independent Software Vendors in the UK

<br><br>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Talks</h3>

<h3>Dr Katie Paxton-Fear: Go Hack Yourself: API hacking for beginners</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og7va5eb8UU" rel="noreferrer">Talk recording</a>
<br><br>
Over the past few years, we've really seen API hacking take off as a field of its own, diverging from typical web app security, but yet parallel to it. Often we point to the amorphous blob that is web security and go: "here you go, now you can be a hacker too", with top 10 lists, write-ups, conference talks and whitepapers smiling as we do. This creates a major challenge for developers who want to test their APIs for security or just people who want to get into API hacking, how on earth do you wade through all the general web security to get to the meat of API hacking, what do you even need to know? This talk is going to break down API hacking from a developer point of view, teaching you everything you need to know about API hacking, from the bugs you can find and to the impact you can cause, to how you can easily test your own work or review your peers. So what are you waiting for join me and go hack yourself!

<br><br>

<b>About Dr Katie Paxton-Fear</b><br>

A lecturer in Cyber Security at Manchester Metropolitan University and a cyber security researcher, but she's far more well known for her hobby. In her free time, she's a hacker, specialising in API hacking teaching others through her YouTube videos. A former developer turned hacker, she used to make RESTful APIs and now she breaks them. She found her first API vulnerability in 2019 which affected Uber and since then she has been hacking APIs ever since, creating hours of content to help others follow in her footsteps. With her PhD in cyber security and machine learning, she loves to introduce a data-driven approach to hacking combining new tools with manual testing to ensure an impactful bug report every time.

<h3>Gerald Benischke - Application DoS vulnerabilities</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2o4m-eE-io" rel="noreferrer">Talk recording</a>
<br><br>
This AppSec-focussed talk demonstrates how denial of service attacks can be carried out without throwing lots and lots of traffic at a system and effectively stop services. This uses a couple of vulnerabilities in the play framework as an example and describes the impact. This approach can be likened to using precision guided missiles rather than the carpet bombing of DDoS attacks.

I will explore the role that convenience for developers in frameworks combined with unexpected payloads and how this can be exploited. I also draw on how the service mesh can amplify this attack such that multiple instances can be killed with a single request. Furthermore, we look at how Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) offer no protection against this type of attack.

Lastly, I will look at what can be done to protect applications against this type of attack.

<br/><br/>
<b>About Gerald Benischke</b><br>

I tend to describe myself as both an Agile Fundamentalist and an AppSec Snooper. What does this mean? On the one hand my software development experience has led me to think that the principles of the agile manifesto form the basis of good practices. It boils down to lots of common sense, small steps, learning along the way, not writing code that nobody will want or need and taking processes and procedures with a pinch of salt.
